# Kendo UI for Vue: UI for ASP.NET Core  

This is a sample application which demonstrates how to use Kendo UI for Vue Native and UI for ASP.NET Core.

The [UI for ASP.NET Core](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-core-ui) and [UI for ASP.NET MVC](http://www.telerik.com/aspnet-mvc) suites provide a `DataSourceRequest` model binder and a `ToDataSourceResult()` method that process operations such as paging, sorting, filtering, grouping, and aggregates.

## Prerequisites:
-  [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/)
-  [.NET Core 3.1](https://www.microsoft.com/net/learn/get-started/windows) (or later) SDK
-  [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) version 6 (or later)

## Get Started

1. Clone this repository by using your favorite Git client or by executing `git clone https://github.com/telerik/kendo-vue.git`.
1. Enter the project directory by running `cd kendo-vue-demo-aspnetcore-data`.
1. Double click on the "VueJSCore.sln" file to open the project.
1. Start the project by clicking on "Debug -> Start Without Debugging" menu or pressing "Ctrl + F5". The first time you start the project all NPM dependencies will be installed automatically and this process may take time.
